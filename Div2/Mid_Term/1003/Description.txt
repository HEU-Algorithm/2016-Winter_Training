Title:
The set of Laotou and Bingxiang --Fibonacci Sequence

Time Limit: 1s

Description:
1，1，2，3，5，8，13，21，34，55.....For every integer n(n>=3),f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2),
Laotou is interested in the sequence.So he want to know the the number of f(n).Owing to the number of f(n) is too larger.
So Laotou want to the result mod 1e9+7.Please tell the Laotou the number of f(n).

Input:
There are several test cases. For each test case ,there is an integer n.(1<=n && n<=1e7)

Output:
For each test case,print an integer f(n) in one line as the result.

Sample Input:
1
2
3
4
5

Sample Output:
1
1
2
