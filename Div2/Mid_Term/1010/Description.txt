Bingxiang and Laotou are on the road  . . . 
"Bingxiang, we have to get this shipment of mudbugs to 21B574 by tonight!" 
"Don't worry, Laotou, I already checked ahead. There are three underpasses and our 18-wheeler will fit through all of them, so just keep that motor running!" 
"We're not going to make it!" Laotou says. 
So, which is it: will there be a very messy accident on 21B, or is Laotou just letting the sound of his own wheels drive him crazy?

There will be exactly one line of output. This line will be: 
"NO CRASH" (if the height of the 18-wheeler is less than the height of each of the underpasses),
or: 
"CRASH X" (where X is the height of the first underpass in the data set that the 18-wheeler is unable to go under ,which means its height is less than or equal to the height of the 18-wheeler).
