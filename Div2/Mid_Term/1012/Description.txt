Bingxiang like Chinese chess,Escially like one kind of powerful chessmen called Cannon. It can move horizontally or vertically along the chess grid. At each move, it can either simply move to another empty cell in the same line without any other chessman along the route or perform an eat action. The eat action, however, is the main concern in this problem. 
An eat action, for example, Cannon A eating chessman B, requires two conditions: 
1、A and B is in either the same row or the same column in the chess grid.
